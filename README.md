Here’s a README.md content tailored for your GitHub folders:

📘 Machine Learning Projects: Linear & Logistic Regression
Welcome to the repository containing implementations of Linear Regression and Logistic Regression from scratch using NumPy. Each folder includes the model file and a test script to demonstrate how the model works.

📁 Folder Structure
linear_regression/
linear_reg.py – Implementation of Linear Regression.

test_linear.py – Code to test the model with synthetic data (randomly generated features with a linear relationship).

logistic_regression/
logistic_reg.py – Implementation of Logistic Regression.

test_logistic.py – Code to test the classifier with generated binary-labeled data.

📌 Algorithms Implemented
🔹 Linear Regression
Type: Supervised, Regression

Loss: Mean Squared Error (MSE)

Optimization: Gradient Descent

Use Case: Predict continuous values (e.g., house prices).

🔹 Logistic Regression
Type: Supervised, Classification

Loss: Binary Cross-Entropy (Log Loss)

Activation: Sigmoid

Optimization: Gradient Descent

Use Case: Classify data points into binary categories (e.g., spam or not spam).

▶️ How to Run
Each model has a corresponding test script.

bash
Copy
Edit
# For linear regression
python test_linear.py

# For logistic regression
python test_logistic.py
Make sure NumPy is installed:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install numpy
🧠 Future Work
Add polynomial regression

Add multi-class logistic regression (Softmax)

Add model evaluation metrics (R², Accuracy, etc.)

Add datasets from scikit-learn for better testing
